# ulauncher-imdb
> Simple ULauncher extensions that allows you to search IMDb with a simple keyword.

## Demo
![ulauncher-imdb demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruudjelinssen/ulauncher-imdb/master/demo.gif)

## Features
At this point the extension is pretty straight forward. You can search IMDb using `imdb <query>` and it opens the browser when you hit enter. In the future, the results will show in ulauncher directly. But I wanted to keep it simple at first.

## Installation
Open ulauncher options and go to `Extensions` > `Add extension` and fill in `https://github.com/ruudjelinssen/ulauncher-imdb`.
